# Loading System Fixes - October 15, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Loading Screen Not Releasing on Navigation**

**Problem**: When clicking "Add Testimonial" or navigating to other pages, the loading screen would show but never disappear, leaving users stuck.

**Root Cause**: The `ClientWrapper` was showing the loading screen on route changes but had no mechanism to hide it for Server Component pages (which don't have access to `setLoading()`).

**Solution**:

- Added automatic timeout in `ClientWrapper` to hide loading screen after 800ms on route changes
- This ensures Server Component pages (testimonials, projects, contact) show content even without manual loading control
- Client Component pages (home) still use manual `setLoading()` control for accurate loading state

### 2. **Loading Screen Background Not Translucent**

**Problem**: Background was too opaque (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.95)`)

**Solution**:

- Changed to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)` for better translucency
- Increased backdrop blur to `backdrop-blur-xl` for better visual effect
- Now you can see the animated background orbs through the loading screen

### 3. **Fonts Not Matching Coder Theme**

**Problem**: Page headings on testimonials, projects, and contact pages didn't use monospace font

**Solution**: Added `font-mono tracking-tight` to all page headings:

- `testimonials/page.tsx` - "Add Your Testimonial"
- `projects/page.tsx` - "All Projects"
- `contact/page.tsx` - "Get In Touch"
- `LoadingScreen.tsx` - "Loading..." text and percentage

## Files Modified

1. **ClientWrapper.tsx**
   - Added automatic 800ms timeout on route changes
   - Added 500ms initial load timeout
   - Ensures loading screen always clears for Server Components

2. **LoadingScreen.tsx**
   - Background: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)` with `backdrop-blur-xl`
   - Added `font-mono` to heading and percentage
   - Added "..." to "Loading" text for better UX

3. **testimonials/page.tsx**
   - Added `font-mono tracking-tight` to h1

4. **projects/page.tsx**
   - Added `font-mono tracking-tight` to h1

5. **contact/page.tsx**
   - Added `font-mono tracking-tight` to h1

6. **page.tsx** (home)
   - Added `setLoading` to dependency array
   - Reduced transition delay to 200ms for faster response

## How It Works Now

### Navigation Flow:

```
User clicks "Add Testimonial"
↓
ClientWrapper detects route change (pathname change)
↓
Loading screen shows (0% → 100%)
↓
800ms timer starts
↓
Server Component renders (testimonials page)
↓
Timer completes → Loading screen fades out
↓
Content appears with smooth opacity transition
```

### For Home Page (Client Component):

```
User navigates to home
↓
ClientWrapper shows loading screen
↓
Home component calls setLoading(true)
↓
Data fetches from Sanity
↓
Data loaded → setLoading(false)
↓
Loading screen fades out → Content appears
```

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Home page loads with loading screen
- ✅ Navigate to testimonials - loading clears automatically
- ✅ Navigate to projects - loading clears automatically
- ✅ Navigate to contact - loading clears automatically
- ✅ Navigate back to home - loading clears after data fetch
- ✅ Loading screen background is translucent
- ✅ All headings use monospace font
- ✅ Progress bar animates smoothly
- ✅ No stuck loading screens

## Configuration

**Loading Times:**

- Initial page load: 500ms
- Route changes: 800ms
- Home page data fetch: ~200ms after fetch completes

These can be adjusted in `ClientWrapper.tsx` if needed.
